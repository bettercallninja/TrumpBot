# TG Stars Integration Documentation

This document outlines the integration of Telegram Stars (TG Stars) into the TrumpBot game system.

## Overview

TG Stars are a premium currency that allows players to purchase exclusive items in the game. These premium items provide enhanced capabilities that aren't available through the regular medal-based economy.

## Features Implemented

### 1. TG Stars Balance

- Players can check their TG Stars balance using the `/stars` command
- The balance is also displayed in the player's status using `/status`

### 2. Premium Shop

- The shop now has a dedicated section for premium items purchasable with TG Stars
- Premium items are marked with a ðŸ’Ž icon

### 3. Premium Inventory

- The inventory display now has a separate section for premium items
- Premium items are clearly distinguished from regular items

### 4. Payment Processing

- Secure payment flow for TG Stars transactions
- Transaction history tracking in the database
- Error handling for failed payments

## Database Structure

The integration utilizes two main database tables:

### 1. Players Table (Existing)

A new column `tg_stars` has been added to the players table to track the balance:

```sql
ALTER TABLE players ADD COLUMN tg_stars INT DEFAULT 0;
```

### 2. TG Stars Purchases Table (New)

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS tg_stars_purchases(
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  chat_id BIGINT,
  user_id BIGINT,
  payment_id TEXT,
  item_id TEXT,
  stars_amount INT,
  purchase_time BIGINT,
  status TEXT
);
```
